I'm a college senior studying CS and Math who wants to have a better understanding of ML and Deep Learning, which is why I'm going through this. 

Please read README.md for better context. I'll basically be asking you questions about each of these lectures. 

IMPORTANT: I'm NOT watching the intented youtube videos on these are they take way too long. Instead, I trust you to read the jupyter notebooks to understand the context and explain them to me.

Don't worry too much about the math at any point. My goal here is to become a good research engineer - the math is therefore not super relevant.
